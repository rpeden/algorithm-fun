# algorithm-fun
Algorithm and data structure practice for fun and profit. Some are from Sedgewick's Algorithms textbook, 4th edition, and some are from other sources. Some of the stuff here is quite basic, but I like to review the basics occasionally to keep my skills sharp. 

NUnit test classes are included in the same file for each exercise.
